Project Overview

The Smart Study Planner is a web-based productivity tool designed to help students organize their study schedules, manage tasks, and track academic progress efficiently. It provides a clean and intuitive interface where users can add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as complete. All data is stored locally in the browser, so no server or database is required.
